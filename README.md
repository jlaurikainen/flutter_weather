### About

Don't you just hate it when all the existing apps don't look, behave, or are
bloated with info you don't need. Not to mention the ads. This is a Flutter app
I made for my own use for diplaying the current weather and minimal amount of
forecast information using
[FMI open data](https://www.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/avoin-data). This app was a way
for me to learn about Flutter for mobile app development.

### What I learned

Honestly not a bad experience on the side of Flutter and Dart. I liked how
tightly typed Dart was. And Flutter seems very feature-complete for creating
UIs. FMI should go die in a fire for offering their data in XML and not JSON.
Though I've no idea what kind of tools Dart has for JSON parsing, maybe they
might be worse? Would make more apps with Flutter. Though Kotlin Multiplatform
might be worth checking out.
